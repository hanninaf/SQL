/*coffe_chain data set from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amruthayenikonda/coffee-chain-sales-dataset*/

/*
We first create two common table expressions (CTEs): MonthlySales and YearlySales.

The MonthlySales CTE calculates the total monthly sales for each product category for the years 2016 and 2017.

The YearlySales CTE calculates the total annual sales for each product category separately for 2016 and 2017.

Finally, we join these CTEs and calculate the sales growth percentage for each product category on a monthly basis by comparing 2017 sales to 2016 sales. The results are rounded to two decimal places and ordered by month and product category.

This query provides insights into how the sales of different product categories have grown or declined on a monthly basis between 2016 and 2017.
